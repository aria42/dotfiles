     <saolsen> but are incompatible the way I'm building the xpath strings so
               I duplicate like everything twice                                                              [15:24:05]
     <saolsen> trying it without xpath at all right now                                                       [15:24:23]

<jeremyheiler> saolsen: seems like that could work well, given that things are
               genearlly found is xml fragments, and not all over the place.                                  [15:25:14]
     <saolsen> yeah, I have a plan                                                                            [15:28:01]
