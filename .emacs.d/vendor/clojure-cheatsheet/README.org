** Installation

If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET clojure-cheatsheet
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively just grab the single =clojure-cheatsheet.el= file and
install that in your preferred way.

** Basic Usage
   
Call =M-x clojure-cheatsheet= and the cheatsheet will appear. Type
in some terms (space separated) to narrow down the list. For example,
try typing in =sort map= to see some functions that deal with sorting maps.

*** Keys
