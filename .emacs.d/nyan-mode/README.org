* Nyan Mode - Turn your Emacs into Nyanmacs! :)

WARNING, MIND DUMBING CONTENT INSIDE.

Nyan Mode is an analog indicator of your position in the buffer. The
Cat should go from left to right in your mode-line, as you move your
point from 0% to 100%.

** Features
  - Mind dumbing content included,
  - Experimental animation (M-x nyan-start-animation, M-x nyan-stop-animation),
  - Customizable properties.

NOT INCLUDED: music.

** Known issues
It's my second attempt to write a minor mode in Emacs, so there will
definiely be some bugs.

Current version uses PNG images, which require libpng to be available
for Emacs. The lib is sometimes missing (e.g. some Windows
installation). To make it work on Windows, one needs to download a
proper DLL and put it into emacs bin/ folder. To see which DLL is needed,
do: M-x describe-variable <ret> image-library-alist <ret>.

So far it didn't work on Emacs 24 :(. Any help with that would be appreciated.

Customizing nyan-animate-nyancat is broken; don't do it.

For animated Nyan Cat, I used frames [[http://media.photobucket.com/image/nyan%20cat%20sprites/DryBowser455/th_NyanCatSprite.png?t=1304659408][by DryBowser455]]. There's also a
standing Nyan and rainbow image, extracted from a gif similar to [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ozp7QtT81xM/TkVqBTYkhjI/AAAAAAAABeM/ZyuDkGeAS6w/s1600/nyan2.gif][this one]].
